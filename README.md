# Home Clock

Home Clock is a simple, customizable and minimalistic clock web application built with Nuxt 3.

It can:

- Display the current time in various formats.
- Display a countdown timer.
- Display a stopwatch.
- Schedule alarms.

## Why?

I'm terrible at concentrating on studying. I found a way: setting timers for each tasks with breaks. But an issue came: all clock websites have a bunch of useless bloat, features, ads, and other distractions.

So I decided to build my own clock app that is simple, minimalistic, and distraction-free. It has only the features I need, and nothing more.

You can fullscreen it to cover the entire screen with just the clock, nothing else, helping you focus on your tasks.
